### To be able to navigate through this repository you can follow these steps:

1. In the SRC/ folder you will find the files that I have created in HTML and SCSS, but also the folder of fonts and images.
2. There are also the folders public/ and docs/, these are created automatically when starting the project. Their functionality is super important when it comes to being able to visualize what is being created.
<em> I'm sure you will want to know a little more about this project, so feel free to contact me for any questions or advice to improve my code!
